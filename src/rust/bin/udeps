# Run `cargo udeps` on our Rust source code. Intended to run within
# our build container, but can also be run directly on a workstation,
# if you so choose.
#
# `cargo-udeps` must run under the nightly toolchain. We must take
# care to install the nightly toolchain with the default profile to
# ensure that we also download the `rustfmt` component for nightly as
# well.
#
# We do this because `tonic_build` is currently compiled using the
# `rustfmt` feature (enabled by default), which formats the generated
# code and makes for better error messages.
#
# See
# https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/index.html#features
# for details.

# the case in the container.
